# paelito

a book maker and reader

## Why Paelito?
This project would tell if a new version of the book has been published.


## How to Use (Ubuntu)

### Making a book
Paelito currently only supports markdown files.

Take a look at [The Botanum](https://github.com/bankole7782/the_botanum) as a sample to create a book.

Create your project in `$HOME/snap/paelito/common/p` and make it follows the laws in [The Botanum](https://github.com/bankole7782/the_botanum)

Then run `paelito.maker book_folder_name` to create your book.

### Viewing a book
Paelito books must be downloaded and placed in the `$HOME/snap/paelito/common/out`.

You can now run `paelito.viewer`
